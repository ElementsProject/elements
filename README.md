Elements Project blockchain platform
====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ElementsProject/elements.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ElementsProject/elements)

https://elementsproject.org

This is the integration and staging tree for the Elements blockchain platform,
a collection of feature experiments and extensions to the Bitcoin protocol.
This platform enables anyone to build their own businesses or networks
pegged to Bitcoin as a sidechain or run as a standalone blockchain with arbitrary asset tokens.

Modes
-----

Elements supports a few different pre-set chains for syncing. Note though some are intended for QA and debugging only:

* Liquid mode: `elementsd -chain=liquidv1` (syncs with Liquid network)
* Bitcoin mainnet mode: `elementsd -chain=main` (not intended to be run for commerce)
* Bitcoin testnet mode: `elementsd -chain=testnet3`
* Bitcoin regtest mode: `elementsd -chain=regtest`
* Elements custom chains: Any other `-chain=` argument. It has regtest-like default parameters that can be over-ridden by the user by a rich set of start-up options.

Confidential Assets
----------------
The latest feature in the Elements blockchain platform is Confidential Assets,
the ability to issue multiple assets on a blockchain where asset identifiers
and amounts are blinded yet auditable through the use of applied cryptography.

 * [Announcement of Confidential Assets](https://blockstream.com/2017/04/03/blockstream-releases-elements-confidential-assets.html)
 * [Confidential Assets Whitepaper](https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf) to be presented [April 7th at Financial Cryptography 2017](http://fc17.ifca.ai/bitcoin/schedule.html) in Malta

Features of the Elements blockchain platform
----------------

Compared to Bitcoin itself, it adds the following features:
 * [Confidential Assets][asset-issuance]
 * [Confidential Transactions][confidential-transactions]
 * [Federated Two-Way Peg][federated-peg]
 * [Signed Blocks][signed-blocks]
 * [Additional opcodes][opcodes]

Previous elements that have been integrated into Bitcoin:
 * Segregated Witness
 * Relative Lock Time

Elements deferred for additional research and standardization:
 * [Schnorr Signatures][schnorr-signatures]

Additional RPC commands and parameters:
* [RPC Docs](https://elementsproject.org/en/doc/)

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.
