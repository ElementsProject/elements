 * If at any time malloc fails then '*error' is set to 'SIMPLICITY_ERR_MALLOC' and 'false' is returned,
 * Otherwise, 'true' is returned indicating that the result was successfully computed and returned in the '*error' value.

 * If the operation completes successfully then '*error' is set to 'SIMPLICITY_NO_ERROR', and the 'cmr' array is filled in with the program's computed CMR.
