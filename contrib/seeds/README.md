# Seeds

Utility to generate the seeds.txt list that is compiled into the client
(see [src/chainparamsseeds.h](/src/chainparamsseeds.h) and other utilities in [contrib/seeds](/contrib/seeds)).

Be sure to update `PATTERN_AGENT` in `makeseeds.py` to include the current version,
and remove old versions as necessary (at a minimum when GetDesirableServiceFlags
changes its default return value, as those are the services which seeds are added
to addrman with).

The seeds compiled into the release are created from sipa's DNS seed and AS map
data. Run the following commands from the `/contrib/seeds` directory:

    curl https://bitcoin.sipa.be/seeds.txt.gz | gzip -dc > seeds_main.txt
    curl https://bitcoin.sipa.be/asmap-filled.dat > asmap-filled.dat
    python3 makeseeds.py -a asmap-filled.dat < seeds_main.txt > nodes_main.txt
    cat nodes_main_manual.txt >> nodes_main.txt
    python3 generate-seeds.py . > ../../src/chainparamsseeds.h
