## Exercise(s)
#
# 1. Implement really dumb/unsafe watchmen to allow pegouts for learning purposes.
#    To custody the coins that users peg in, you need to extract the tweak from
#    the pegin claim, use this tweak to adjust the secret keys, and import the
#    resulting keys to a Core wallet.
#
# 2. Create an alternate peg from testnet to Liquid, using asset issuance and
#    destruction.
#
# 3. Implement a round-robin blocksigner protocol, where each signer takes a turn
#    proposing blocks for the others to sign.

# Let's create a basic transaction using the raw api, blind it, sign, and send

# Create a transaction with a single destination output to other wallet.
rawtx = e1.createrawtransaction([], [{ e2.getnewaddress(): 100 }])
# Biggest difference compared to Bitcoin is that we have explicit fee outputs,
# which may be set in `createrawtransaction`. These will be added or adjusted
# by `fundrawtransaction` to make the transaction balance.
rawtx2 = e1.createrawtransaction(
    [],

# Fee outputs are unblinded, with a scriptPubKey of "". On Elements, empty
# scriptPubKeys are unspendable.

# Next we can fund the transaction (and replaces fee with something more appropriate)
fundedtx = e1.fundrawtransaction(rawtx2)

# Blind
blindedtx = e1.blindrawtransaction(fundedtx["hex"])

# In some cases, such as when there is one blinded output but no blinded inputs,
# blinding will fail. The `ignoreblindfails` option to `blindrawtransaction` may
# be set, in which case the transaction will "successfully" not be blinded.
#
# To unconditionally blind a transaction, ensure that it has 2 or more outputs,
# which will ensure that blinding is (a) useful and (b) mathematically possible.

# Sign
signedtx = e1.signrawtransactionwithwallet(blindedtx)

# And send
txid = e1.sendrawtransaction(signedtx["hex"])
