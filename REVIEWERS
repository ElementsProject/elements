# ==============================================================================

# Configuration of automated review requests for the bitcoin/bitcoin repo
# via DrahtBot.

# Order is not important; if a modified file or directory matches a fnmatch,
# the reviewer will be mentioned in a PR comment requesting a review.

# Regular contributors are free to add their names to specific directories or
# files provided that they are willing to provide a review.

# Absence from this list should not be interpreted as a discouragement to
# review a pull request. Peer review is always welcome and is a critical
# component of the progress of the codebase. Information on peer review
# guidelines can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md doc.
